## Results from our implementation

- run plot_70.py to generate to generate Figure 1 in the submission: Number of samples needed to achieve F1 score of 70%
- run plot_95.py to generate to generate Figure 2 in the submission: Number of samples needed to achieve F1 score of 95%

The values were obtained by running main.py for AIDE, baseline_random.py for random, and baseline_grid.py for random-grid, with the correspoding user queries and score thresholds. The values were obtained and store in the following spread sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18flWm0JP8ahT1bnUC0zL-qgjynz-Cf2DBLzQ0Xkw9Ho/edit?usp=sharing
